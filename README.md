 It is essential to learn English vocabulary words. Without sufficient vocabulary, everything else becomes a castle in the air. 
 Thus teachers would always like to monitor the progress of each studentâ€™s English vocabulary and to give appropriate help; 
 however, keeping track of the learning progress is cumbersome. 
 
 In 2019, I designed and developed VocBooster English word learning app to assist language teachers of UIC ACE in solving this problem. 
 The objective of building VocBooster is two-twofold. First, all teachers need to do is enter a list of plain English words that 
 they would like their students to master this week. Then, VocBooster automatically generates different types of English exercises, 
 synthesizes audio sounds and produces progress reports. Second, without any installation, 
 students can use VocBooster to learn anywhere and at any time on their mobile phone. There are seven kinds of English exercises: 
 (a) Flashcard (b) Quiz (c) Three types of dictations (d) dictionary definition multiple-choice test and 
 (e) word usage multiple-choice test. VocBooster provides a ranking system (e.g.Top 10%, 20%, etc) to motivate students to learn more.
